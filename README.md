                                      ¬∑ picgo plugin for neovim ¬∑

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Perfect-neovim%20picgo-green)

**nvim-picgo** is a picture uploading tool based on Lua language. You can quickly upload images to various image beds through it, and it will also generate links in markdown format üîó. and store it in the clipboard.

In the coc ecosystem, there is a plugin called **[coc-picgo](https://github.com/PLDaily/coc-picgo)** that does the same thing.
The **[coc-picgo](https://github.com/PLDaily/coc-picgo)** plugin is really enviable for those who use nvim's built-in LSP, because we don't need cocÔºåso I created this project and hope it will help you.

## Features

- Written in pure Lua, less than 300 lines of code
- No default key bindings, I won't take up your precious keys
- Quickly upload disk files or clipboard images to the image bed, allowing you to access your images anywhere on the Internet

## demo

Upload an image from the clipboard:

Upload an image from the file system:

## Dependencies

I recommend you to use **neovim-0.7**.

Besides that, you need to download **[picgo-core](https://github.com/PicGo/PicGo-Core)**, which is a command line tool.

```
$ npm install picgo -g
```

Next, you need to install **[xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip)**.

## Configure picgo image bed

First of all, you need to manually fill in your image bed configuration, and enter:

> Note, not in neovim's cmd mode

```
$ picgo set uploader
? Choose a(n) uploader (Use arrow keys)
  smms
‚ùØ tcyun
  github
  qiniu
  imgur
  aliyun
  upyun
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

Or you can also configure manually:

- Linux and MacÔºö`~/.config/.picgo/config.json`
- WindowsÔºö`C:\Users\youername\.picgo\config.json`

Below is my picgo config file:

```
$ cat $HOME/.picgo/config.json

{
  "picBed": {
    "uploader": "tcyun",
    "current": "tcyun",
    "tcyun": {
      "secretId": "..",
      "secretKey": "..",
      "bucket": "images-1302522496",
      "appId": "1302522496",
      "area": "ap-nanjing",
      "path": "img/",
      "customUrl": "",
      "version": "v5"
    }
  },
  "picgoPlugins": {}
}
```

## Using plugins

It is recommended to use Packer to manage **nvim-picgo**:

```
use {
    "askfiy/nvim-picgo",
    config = function()
        -- it doesn't require you to do any configuration
        require("nvim-picgo").setup()
    end
    }
```

Default configuration items:

```
{
    -- method to informe
    -- 1. notify
    -- 2. echo
    notice = "notify",
    -- Whether the generated markdown link saves the upload name of the image
    -- boolean
    image_name = false,
    -- debug mode
    debug = false,
}
```

## plugin command

vimlÔºö

```
:UploadClipboard<cr>
:UploadImagefile<cr>
```

luaÔºö

```
<cmd>lua require'nvim-picgo'.upload_clipboard()<cr>
<cmd>lua require'nvim-picgo'.upload_imagefile()<cr>
```
